WordPress Version 4.3 or later #WordPress Version 4.3 or later
WordPress Version 4.3 implemented a Site Icon feature that enables favicons on your web site.

When you use the Site Icon feature, you donâ€™t need to prepare the favicon.ico file by yourself, or modify your template file. All you have to do is navigate to the Customize screen and specify a square image that has a height and width of at least 512 px.

Later paragraphs in this article contain instructions for manually setting up your own favicon. However, it is highly recommended that you use the Site Icon feature (a feature that is built-in to WordPress) instead.

Follow the steps below to use Site Icon to set up a favicon for your site.

Prepare the image file. (It must be square, having a height and width of at least 512 px.)
Navigate to Administration Screen > Appearance > Customize
Click Site Identity
Click Select Image (located under the Site Icon subheading).
Click on the Upload Files tab, then click Select Files to upload the image file that you prepared in the previous step.
